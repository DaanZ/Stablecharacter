## tasks

- [ ] create channel for feature requests

what is the ideal outcome here? people go on discord and than they type "/chat" followed by the personality they want to chat with and than they get via dm a response from the personality type they wanna chat with. if they had in total triggered 5 messages from the bot they get a message that they first need to subscribe to further chat. they get forwarded to stripe where they have to pay 10â‚¬ for unlimited chats. can also add the function that they first would need to define the bot before start with chatting - type, age, gender and name 


i just need one personality class and a script for dealing with discord. the rest is an ease. 

once i have cash i also could join a college to get into the usa. i create the most advanced nsfw chat additionally. i also could try to raise money for scaling that once i got users. i want users!!!!!!!!!
