# 16personalities_chat


Setup & Onboarding: When a user first joins the server, use a dedicated onboarding channel to gather the user's information such as name and gender. This can be done through a bot that sends them a DM or asks in the onboarding channel itself. Make sure to explain what the information is being used for and how they can configure their own bot.

Bot Configuration: Next, users could go to a "bot configuration" channel where they can choose their bot's name, age, gender, and personality type. This channel should have a bot that can receive these parameters, maybe through specific commands.

Private Channels: Once the bot has been configured, you would then create a private channel or a group DM for the user and their bot. Only that user and the bot would be able to access this channel, ensuring privacy.

Bot Creation: You would need a way to dynamically create and configure bots based on user input. Each bot would need to be connected to a user's private channel and use the chosen personality type. This might involve integration with a service that provides personality-driven chatbot responses (like a ChatGPT API), or it could mean creating your own system of responses based on personality type.

Rules and Regulations: Make sure to clearly list the rules and regulations of the server, including how the user's data will be used and any behavior guidelines for interacting with the bots.

User Support: Finally, you'll want to have a user support channel where users can ask for help if they're having trouble with their bot or anything else on the server.


how can i do a slash command instead and helper for the required fields like 

"/chat user_name: user_gender: bot_name: bot_age: bot_gender: bot_personality:" 



## tasks


- [ ] create slash command /chat [username] ... 

- [ ] create channel for feature requests 
- [ ] create a video where i demonstrate how its possible to create a bot
- [ ] make this avatars from discord available on gather town

- [ ] once i have 100 paying users i am going to buy the discord tshirt

lets build the metaverse 

what is the ideal outcome here? people go on discord and than they type "/chat" followed by the personality they want to chat with and than they get via dm a response from the personality type they wanna chat with. if they had in total triggered 5 messages from the bot they get a message that they first need to subscribe to further chat. they get forwarded to stripe where they have to pay 10â‚¬ for unlimited chats. can also add the function that they first would need to define the bot before start with chatting - type, age, gender and name 


i just need one personality class and a script for dealing with discord. the rest is an ease. 

once i have cash i also could join a college to get into the usa. i create the most advanced nsfw chat additionally. i also could try to raise money for scaling that once i got users. i want users!!!!!!!!!
