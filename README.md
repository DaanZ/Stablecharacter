- [ ] simple system where user can choose between 32 mbti options
- [ ] after the user has send 3 messages in current session he has to login with google to continue (for now no paywall in order to build the product well)
- [ ] store messages in db 
- [ ] make it pretty and ship


alright so right now there are no persistent chats. i would like to make a new user interface for the case a user is logged in. it basically should show all the chats on the left side and the current chat in the main field like its the case if you open a chat app in the browser. how can we do this



- make ads on reddit (should take the spend 500$ get 500$ offer) and enable reddit auth to trace the signups from reddit and then chat with them
- go through all of the feedback in reddit and implement each of the points in the feedback into the app
- enable anime version characters in the same color styles like the real mbti types
    - might need to finetune img gen models here 
- enable photos in the chat (this is closely related to the previous point)
- build a monetanization feature, something like $9,99 a month - could include for example the previous points, ie you can get images if you pay 9.99$ bucks
- store the chats on the left side of the chat
- make an IOS app - for humans its most natural to have a chat via ios app, thats just the natural way how humans are chatting
- rebrand to klons.ai and choose the stick figure with black background as an profile image
- restructure codebase (700 lines in page.tsx is def to long)

a few things i am considering to add is a way to track retention of a user and another thing is to make user upgrade to upgrade to paid plan at a combined of 20 messages maybe

- [ ] make a way to track retention
- [ ] find a good number of total messages send for monetanisation
- [ ] add anime characters to the app 


top prio list of features i have to implement:

i do wanna add a paywall at 20 total messages send to be able to make some cash

- user retention
- make commercial after 20 messages 
- make reddit marketing
- make reddit ads
