# 16personalities_chat

Setup & Onboarding: When a user first joins the server, use a dedicated onboarding channel to gather the user's information such as name and gender. This can be done through a bot that sends them a DM or asks in the onboarding channel itself. Make sure to explain what the information is being used for and how they can configure their own bot.

Bot Configuration: Next, users could go to a "bot configuration" channel where they can choose their bot's name, age, gender, and personality type. This channel should have a bot that can receive these parameters, maybe through specific commands.

Private Channels: Once the bot has been configured, you would then create a private channel or a group DM for the user and their bot. Only that user and the bot would be able to access this channel, ensuring privacy.

Bot Creation: You would need a way to dynamically create and configure bots based on user input. Each bot would need to be connected to a user's private channel and use the chosen personality type. This might involve integration with a service that provides personality-driven chatbot responses (like a ChatGPT API), or it could mean creating your own system of responses based on personality type.

Rules and Regulations: Make sure to clearly list the rules and regulations of the server, including how the user's data will be used and any behavior guidelines for interacting with the bots.

User Support: Finally, you'll want to have a user support channel where users can ask for help if they're having trouble with their bot or anything else on the server.


how can i do a slash command instead and helper for the required fields like 

"/chat user_name: user_gender: bot_name: bot_age: bot_gender: bot_personality:" 

either i have 16 different bots where each bot has a static personality or i have one bot who is sending a image in the channel. i think it would be cooler to have 16 different bots because than you have this profile. i think its cooler to have 16 bots because than its more personalized. shit i even need 32 types. for male and female. thats shit. can create 32 bots. 

i am thinking if i than should rather create 32 unique bots (all 16 personalities twice because of gender) or if i should have one bot only (i still can give him the personality traits but the bot will not have the profile image of the respective mbti type). 

i am sending now a single dm to a user. how can i 

cool than i will have the conversation there. need to embedd the chat their now.

every message from the bot inside the thread contains an embed with an image of the certain type. the first message is a normal message with all the details. 


i am completely blown away from the opportunities you have if you only focus on the backend. literally all the sales bots can be represented via discord. the opportunities are enourmously. there is so much cash to make its incredible. holy cow.

i am creating a chatbot for discord. everytime the user is sending message i take the whole chathistory and send it to openai to generate an response. in the meanwhile the user can send another message which can be confusing. how can i handle this problem?

next step is to a either create embed or to chat and test around the different characters

my goal is to have a chatbot who is pretty good in interactions with humans. he still 


i am creating a chatbot. i give him some personality via system prompt. is that enough for having chatgpt act like this personality for the whole chat or do i need to add to each message another small prompt as an reminder to act like a certain personality?

    - inside thread

    paid version:

    - chat via dm
    - better model
    - unlimited messages
    - bot sends images

lets build the metaverse 

what is the ideal outcome here? people go on discord and than they type "/chat" followed by the personality they want to chat with and than they get via dm a response from the personality type they wanna chat with. if they had in total triggered 5 messages from the bot they get a message that they first need to subscribe to further chat. they get forwarded to stripe where they have to pay 10â‚¬ for unlimited chats. can also add the function that they first would need to define the bot before start with chatting - type, age, gender and name 

### later

- [ ] make color of embed appropriate to p type




i just need one personality class and a script for dealing with discord. the rest is an ease. 

once i have cash i also could join a college to get into the usa. i create the most advanced nsfw chat additionally. i also could try to raise money for scaling that once i got users. i want users!!!!!!!!!
